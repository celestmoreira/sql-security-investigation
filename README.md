# SQL Security Investigation Project

This project was completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. The goal was to practice using SQL to investigate potential security issues related to login activity and employee systems.

In this project, I analyzed login attempts and employee data to identify suspicious activity and determine which employee machines required different security updates.

All work for this project, including SQL queries, explanations, and screenshots of query output, is documented in [project.md](project.md). The [screenshots](screenshots/) folder contains terminal output from the lab environment.

## Skills Practiced

- Writing SQL queries using `SELECT` and `WHERE`
- Filtering data with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`
- Using `LIKE` and wildcards to match patterns
- Filtering login activity by time and date
- Analyzing login attempts for security investigations
- Querying employee data to support system updates

## Tools Used

- SQL
- MariaDB (MySQL-compatible)
- Command line database interface
- GitHub for documentation and version control
